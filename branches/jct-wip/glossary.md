The following key terms are used throughout this specification and are part of the IHE Glossary:


* **Medication Order** - any type of order for medicinal products - can be a proposal, a draft, a plan, a prescription or an instance order / Administration Request.  

* **Prescription** - an order given by a clinician (usually physicians and in some
particular cases pharmacists, nurses, etc.), for a medication to be dispensed to the patient and given to or taken by the patient.  

* **Dispense** - the act of assigning a medication to a patient, normally as indicated in the authorizing prescription.
  > Note: in many cases, the "dispense process" entails more activities, such as preparation, packaging, transport, etc. These vary according to the scenario - community or hospital, unit dose or traditional dispensing,... while the single differentiation activity that defines a Dispense is the assignment of a product that was available, to a specific patient.

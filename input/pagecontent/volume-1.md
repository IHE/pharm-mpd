## XX.2 ToDo Actor Options

Options that may be selected for each actor in this implementation guide, are listed in Table 3.2-1 below. Dependencies
between options when applicable are specified in notes.

### XX.2.1 AB Option

**TODO: describe this option and the Volume 1 requirements for this option

<a name="required-groupings"> </a>

## XX.3 ToDo Required Actor Groupings

*Describe any requirements for actors in this profile to be grouped
with other actors.*

*This section specifies all REQUIRED Actor Groupings (although
"required" sometimes allows for a selection of one of several). To
SUGGEST other profile groupings or helpful references for other profiles
to consider, use Section XX.6 Cross Profile Considerations. Use Section
X.5 for security profile recommendations.*

An actor from this profile (Column 1) shall implement all of the
required transactions and/or content modules in this profile ***in
addition to*** ***<u>all</u>*** of the requirements for the grouped
actor (Column 2) (Column 3 in alternative 2).

If this is a content profile, and actors from this profile are grouped
with actors from a workflow or transport profile, the Reference column
references any specifications for mapping data from the content module
into data elements from the workflow or transport transactions.

In some cases, required groupings are defined as at least one of an
enumerated set of possible actors; this is designated by merging column
one into a single cell spanning multiple potential grouped actors. Notes
are used to highlight this situation.

Section XX.5 describes some optional groupings that may be of interest
for security considerations and Section XX.6 describes some optional
groupings in other related profiles.

Two alternatives for Table XX.3-1 are presented below.

* If there are no required groupings for any actor in this profile,
    use alternative 1 as a template.
* If an actor in this profile (with no option), has a required
    grouping, use alternative 1.
* If any required grouping is associated with an actor/option
    combination in this profile, use alternative 2.

alternative 1 Table XX.3-1: Profile Name - Required Actor
Groupings

All actors from this profile should be listed in Column 1, even if
none of the actors has a required groupings. If no required grouping
exists, "None" should be indicated in Column 2. If an actor in a content
profile is required to be grouped with an actor in a transport or
workflow profile, it will be listed **with at least one** required
grouping. Do not use "XD\*" as an actor name.

In some cases, required groupings are defined as at least one of an
enumerated set of possible actors; to designate this, create a row for
each potential actor grouping and merge column one to form a single cell
containing the profile actor which should be grouped with at least one
of the actors in the spanned rows. In addition, a note should be
included to explain the enumerated set. See example below showing
Document Consumer needing to be grouped with at least one of XDS.b
Document Consumer, XDR Document Recipient or XDM Portable Media
Importer

The author should pay special consideration to security profiles in
this grouping section. Consideration should be given to Consistent Time
(CT) Client, ATNA Secure Node or Secure Application, as well as other
profiles. For the sake of clarity and completeness, even if this table
begins to become long, a line should be added for each actor for each of
the required grouping for security. Also see the ITI document titled
'Cookbook: Preparing the IHE Profile Security Section' at
<http://ihe.net/Technical_Frameworks/#IT> for a list of suggested IT and
security groupings.

* Required Actor Groupings

All actors from this profile should be listed in Column 1. If no
required grouping exists, "None" should be indicated in Column 3.

Guidance on using the "Grouping Condition" column:

* If an actor has no required grouping, Column 2 should contain "--".
    See Actor A below.
* If an actor has a required grouping that is not associated with a
    profile option (i.e., it has no condition), column 2 should contain
    "Required". See Actor B below.
* Sometimes an option requires that an actor in this profile be
    grouped with an actor in another profile. That condition is
    specified in Column 2. See Actor C below.

## XX.4 ToDo Overview

This section shows how the transactions/content modules of the profile
are combined to address the use cases.

Use cases are informative, not normative, and "SHALL" language is
not allowed in use cases.

### XX.4.1 Concepts

If needed, this section provides an overview of the concepts that
provide necessary background for understanding the profile. If not
needed, state "Not applicable." For an example of why/how this section
may be needed, please see ITI Cross Enterprise Workflow (XDW).

It may be useful in this section but is not necessary, to provide a
short list of the use cases described below and explain why they are
different.

### XX.4.2 Use Cases

For use Cases please go [here](usecases.html).



<a name="security-considerations"> </a>

## XX.5 ToDo Security Considerations

See ITI TF-2x: [Appendix Z.8 "Mobile Security Considerations"](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.8-mobile-security-considerations)

The following is instructions to the editor and this text is not to be included in a publication.
The material initially from [RFC 3552 "Security Considerations Guidelines" July 2003](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3552).

This section should address downstream design considerations, specifically for: Privacy, Security, and Safety. These might need to be individual header sections if they are significant or need to be referenced.

The editor needs to understand Security and Privacy fundamentals.
General [Security and Privacy guidance]({{site.data.fhir.path}}secpriv-module.html) is provided in the FHIR Specification. 
The FHIR core specification should be leveraged where possible to inform the reader of your specification.

IHE FHIR based profiles should reference the [PHARM Appendix Z](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html) section 8 Mobile Security and Privacy Considerations base when appropriate.

IHE Document Content profiles can reference the security and privacy provided by the Document Sharing infrastructure as directly grouped or possibly to be grouped.

   While it is not a requirement that any given specification or system be
   immune to all forms of attack, it is still necessary for authors of specifications to
   consider as many forms as possible.  Part of the purpose of the
   Security and Privacy Considerations section is to explain what attacks have been
   considered and what countermeasures can be applied to defend against them.

   There should be a clear description of the kinds of threats on the
   described specification.  This should be approached as an
   effort to perform "due diligence" in describing all known or
   foreseeable risks and threats to potential implementers and users.

Authors MUST describe:

* which attacks have been considered and addressed in the specification
* which attacks have been considered but not addressed in the specification
* what could be done in system design, system deployment, or user training

   At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered:
   eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and
   man-in-the-middle.  Potential denial of service attacks MUST be
   identified as well.  If the specification incorporates cryptographic
   protection mechanisms, it should be clearly indicated which portions
   of the data are protected and what the protections are (i.e.,
   integrity only, confidentiality, and/or endpoint authentication,
   etc.).  Some indication should also be given to what sorts of attacks
   the cryptographic protection is susceptible.  Data which should be
   held secret (keying material, random seeds, etc.) should be clearly
   labeled.

   If the specification involves authentication, particularly user-host
   authentication, the security of the authentication method MUST be
   clearly specified.  That is, authors MUST document the assumptions
   that the security of this authentication method is predicated upon.

   The threat environment addressed by the Security and Privacy Considerations
   section MUST at a minimum include deployment across the global
   Internet across multiple administrative boundaries without assuming
   that firewalls are in place, even if only to provide justification
   for why such consideration is out of scope for the protocol.  It is
   not acceptable to only discuss threats applicable to LANs and ignore
   the broader threat environment.  In
   some cases, there might be an Applicability Statement discouraging
   use of a technology or protocol in a particular environment.
   Nonetheless, the security issues of broader deployment should be
   discussed in the document.

   There should be a clear description of the residual risk to the user
   or operator of that specification after threat mitigation has been
   deployed.  Such risks might arise from compromise in a related
   specification (e.g., IPsec is useless if key management has been
   compromised), from incorrect implementation, compromise of the
   security technology used for risk reduction (e.g., a cipher with a
   40-bit key), or there might be risks that are not addressed by the
   specification (e.g., denial of service attacks on an
   underlying link protocol).  Particular care should be taken in
   situations where the compromise of a single system would compromise
   an entire protocol.  For instance, in general specification designers
   assume that end-systems are inviolate and don't worry about physical
   attack.  However, in cases (such as a certificate authority) where
   compromise of a single system could lead to widespread compromises,
   it is appropriate to consider systems and physical security as well.

   There should also be some discussion of potential security risks
   arising from potential misapplications of the specification or technology
   described in the specification.  
  
This section also include specific considerations regarding Digital Signatures, Provenance, Audit Logging, and De-Identification.

Where audit logging is specified, a StructureDefinition profile(s) should be included, and Examples of those logs might be included.

## XX.6 ToDo Cross-Profile Considerations

This section is informative, not normative. It is intended to put
this profile in context with other profiles. Any required groupings
should have already been described above. Brief descriptions can go
directly into this section; lengthy descriptions should go into an
appendix. Examples of this material include ITI Cross Community Access
(XCA) Grouping Rules (Section 18.2.3), the Radiology associated profiles
listed at wiki.ihe.net, or ITI Volume 1 Appendix E "Cross Profile
Considerations", and the "See Also" sections Radiology Profile
descriptions on the wiki such as
<http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Scheduled_Workflow#See_Also>. If this
section is left blank, add "Not applicable."

Consider using a format such as the following:

other profile acronym - other profile name

A other profile actor name in other profile name might
be grouped with a this profile actor name to describe
benefit/what is accomplished by grouping.
